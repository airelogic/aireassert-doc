<h2 id="what-is-aireassert">What is AireAssert?</h2>
<p>AireAssert is a low-code testing tool designed specifically to work with the AireLogic suite of products. It will allow you to quickly create and run suites of checks against the solutions you build with our tools. Currently, support extends to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Forms4Health/AireForms: Create tests which exercise your forms. Support is included for most features of F4H, letting you test complex scenarios on forms with custom logic or scoring, or to interact with complicated form UI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AireGlu: Verify that pipelines have been called, and verify their outputs. Test them individually or trigger them from other products to create joined-up tests of your entire solution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AireFlow (Alpha): Verify the route taken through a workflow and its outputs. Trigger from any other product, or forward to AireGlu to verify your entire workflow.</p>
  </li>
